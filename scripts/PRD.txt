- **LLM-Powered Fortune Telling**
  - Generates a unique, randomized fortune for the user using AI/LLM or a simulated approach.
  - Adds entertainment value and replayability.
  - Integrates with an LLM API or uses a local randomization algorithm for fortune generation.
- **User Input Handling**
  - Prompts the user for their birth date and year in a user-friendly way.
  - Ensures input is validated and errors are handled gracefully.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**: Astrology enthusiasts, casual users, people seeking entertainment or daily inspiration.

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**:
  - Input handler (CLI or web form)
  - Star sign calculator module
  - Fortune generator (LLM API integration or local randomizer)
  - Output renderer (console or web UI)
- **Data Models**:
  - User input: birth date, year
  - Zodiac sign definitions (date ranges)
  - Fortune templates or LLM prompts
- **APIs and Integrations**:
  - Optional: Integration with OpenAI or similar LLM for fortune generation
- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Node.js runtime
  - (Optional) API key management for LLM

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements**:
  - CLI app that prompts for birth date/year, returns star sign and random fortune
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Basic set of fortune templates if LLM is not used
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Web UI version
  - Integration with real LLM API for more dynamic fortunes
  - User history and sharing features

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Implement input handler and validation first
- Build star sign calculator module
- Add fortune generator (start with local randomizer, then LLM integration)
- Integrate modules and render output
- (Optional) Add web UI and advanced features

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical challenges**: LLM API integration may require API keys and error handling; fallback to local randomizer if needed
- **MVP scoping**: Focus on CLI MVP to ensure rapid delivery
- **Resource constraints**: Use open-source libraries and keep dependencies minimal
