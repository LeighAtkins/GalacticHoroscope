      "taskTitle": "Initialize Node.js Project Structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Node.js project initialization into setup phases: 1) Basic npm and directory structure, 2) Dependencies and configuration files, 3) Git setup and documentation",
      "reasoning": "This is a straightforward setup task with well-defined steps. The complexity is low as these are standard procedures for Node.js projects, but it requires attention to detail for proper configuration."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Date Input Handler",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Date Input Handler implementation into: 1) CLI interface setup, 2) Date validation core logic, 3) Edge case handling, 4) Error handling and user feedback",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to validation requirements and edge cases. Date handling often has subtle complexities around leap years, different date formats, and user input validation."

      "taskTitle": "Create Zodiac Sign Calculator",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the Zodiac Calculator into: 1) Data structure for zodiac sign definitions, 2) Core calculation logic, 3) Edge case handling for sign boundaries",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving date range comparisons and boundary conditions. The logic is straightforward but requires careful implementation of date ranges and edge cases at sign transitions."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Local Fortune Generator",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the Fortune Generator into: 1) Template system design, 2) Randomization engine, 3) Content creation for fortune templates",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to the need for a flexible template system and randomization logic. Creating varied and interesting fortune templates that feel unique requires creative effort."

      "taskTitle": "Setup LLM Integration Framework",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM integration into: 1) API client implementation, 2) Authentication and configuration, 3) Retry and error handling, 4) Fallback mechanism, 5) Response processing and caching",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to external API integration, error handling, and fallback mechanisms. Working with LLMs requires careful prompt engineering, response parsing, and handling API limitations."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Output Renderer",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Output Renderer into: 1) Core formatting engine, 2) ASCII art implementation, 3) Color and styling system",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity focused on presentation. Creating visually appealing console output with proper formatting and ASCII art requires attention to detail and testing across different terminal environments."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Core Components",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the integration work into: 1) Application flow design, 2) Component wiring, 3) Error handling system, 4) Testing and optimization",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to connecting multiple components and ensuring they work together seamlessly. This task requires understanding of all previous components and careful error handling across boundaries."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CLI Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the CLI implementation into: 1) Command parsing and routing, 2) Interactive mode implementation, 3) Help system and documentation",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring good UX design for command-line interactions. Creating an intuitive CLI requires balancing simplicity with functionality and providing clear help documentation."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Configuration Management",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide configuration management into: 1) Configuration loading system, 2) Validation and defaults, 3) Override mechanisms and environment integration",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to the need for a flexible, hierarchical configuration system. Proper configuration management requires handling multiple sources with correct precedence and validation."
    },

      "expansionPrompt": "Structure documentation work into: 1) User guide and setup instructions, 2) API and configuration reference, 3) Examples and tutorials, 4) Maintenance and contribution guidelines",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the comprehensive nature of documentation across multiple components. Good documentation requires understanding the entire system and explaining it clearly for different audiences."
